Welcome to the ZEW workshop on Data Science with R. I'm pretty much excited to share something that passionates me. These sessions are centered on the Tidyverse "philosophy" of how to work in R. Therefore, some of the basic functions are not going to be covered, but try to be included as a comparison, though.
